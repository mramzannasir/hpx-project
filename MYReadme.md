Community owned NFT market place with a 10,000x native token

# desc

Hpx is a marketplace for NFT trading based on the Pulse Chain network.
Make profits by owning $Hpx as one of our company's shareholders.

# 2nd Section heading:

$Hpx, and earn PLS,
pHex, PLSX, and USDL daily as rewards

# 2nd Section 2nd :

To reward our earliest sacricers we made a bonus for them, the earlier you sacrifice the more points you will earn!

# 2nd Section 2nd :

By making Pulsechain, PulseX and pHex a pay-per-listing method (which no other pulse nft marketplace has done).
We are increasing their prices exponentially.

Imagine this, if someone wants to buy an NFT listed by pHex, Pls, PlsX, they will be forced to trade them or buy them, in order to pay for their favorite NFTs. And above all, there will be more than 20,000,000 NFTs available on Hpx! That's almost x100 more than all p-erc-20 available on PulseChain!

## vedio lower section:

This is an estimate and only includes Sacrifices on the Ethereum chain.

# 2nd Graph desc:

Hpx will work as an index for all nfts on Pulsechain. Once an nft transaction is made through our platform, you will earn interest each time a transaction is made, just like a shareholder of a company.

% HPX Status:
Couple days after the PulseChain mainnet release Sacrificers will be able to access their HPX.

$Hpx is designed to increase in value

$Hpx will be used as one of four different trading methods, which will be the only one to benefit the x10 cheaper commission fee’s than other trading methods. (From 2.222% to 0.222%)

2nd: Pulsechain, pHex, pulseX and the USDL will be available as well for Nft trading methods. Once the trade is completed, they will be committed to an 2.22% commission fee.
